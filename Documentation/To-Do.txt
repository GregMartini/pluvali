Things to implement or fix:

1) Back button problems (doesn't show tokens properly, errors if done while playing game)

	2) Store page purchases (Tim)

	5) Scenario editor (Alex)

7) Pop-up videos that must be watched before selecting an answer

8) Text-to-Speech (if easy)

9) Format tables pages into tables for easier viewing.

10) Store button color purchases

12) Player groups so admins can easily link scenarios to players (default group should be able to handle this, might need additional setup)

14) Make buttons highlighted when moused over.

15) Store/profile page - coin button to buy, paint brush button to apply, give option to change font (profile page only)

16) Game page - have a pop up after every one saying you earned a token

17) Congratulations - have a "thumbs up" image (or something similar) on the page


FINISHED:

	3) Delete a USER also deletes a PLAYER

	4) Uniform wording across pages (tokens/points, index/homepage)
	
	6) User profile page (edit picture)
	
	11) Button links, not text links (started not finished)
	
	13) Links/text centered vertically. Text by the "store" button should be default font. DDRC header to footer

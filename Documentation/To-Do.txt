Things to implement or fix:

1) Back button problems (doesn't show tokens properly, errors if done while playing game)


	5) Scenario editor (Alex)

7) Pop-up videos that must be watched before selecting an answer

8) Text-to-Speech (if easy)

	9) Format tables pages into tables for easier viewing. (formatted into tables, just missing percentages to keep formatted)

10) Store button color purchases

12) Player groups so admins can easily link scenarios to players (default group should be able to handle this, might need additional setup)

14) Make buttons highlighted when moused over.

15b) Store/profile page - paint brush button to apply

16) Game page - have a pop up after every one saying you earned a token


FINISHED:
	2) Store page purchases

	3) Delete a USER also deletes a PLAYER

	4) Uniform wording across pages (tokens/points, index/homepage)
	
	6) User profile page (edit picture)
	
	11) Button links, not text links
	
	13) Links/text centered vertically. Text by the "store" button should be default font. DDRC header to footer

	15a) Store/profile page - coin button to buy, give option to change font (profile page only)

	17) Congratulations - have a "thumbs up" image (or something similar) on the page

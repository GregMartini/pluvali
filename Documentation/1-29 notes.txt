Things to implement or fix:

1) Back button problems (doesn't show tokens properly, errors if done while playing game)

2) Store page purchases (redirecting to same page, maybe a confirmation before buying)

5) Scenario editor

	6) User profile page (edit picture) (started not finished)

7) Pop-up videos that must be watched before selecting an answer

8) Text-to-Speech (if easy)

9) Format tables pages into tables for easier viewing.

10) Store button color purchases

	11) Button links, not text links (started not finished)

12) Player groups so admins can easily link scenarios to players (default group should be able to handle this, might need additional setup)

FINISHED:

	3) Delete a USER also deletes a PLAYER

	4) Uniform wording across pages (tokens/points, index/homepage)

Things to implement or fix:

1) Back button problems (doesn't show tokens properly, errors if done while playing game)

2) Store page purchases (redirecting to same page, maybe a confirmation before buying)

3) Delete a USER also deletes a PLAYER

4) Uniform wording across pages (tokens/points, index/homepage)

5) Scenario editor

6) User profile page (delete/restart account, edit picture)

7) Pop-up videos that must be watched before selecting an answer (maybe)

8) Text-to-Speech (maybe)
